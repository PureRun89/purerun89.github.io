|    Build NetHack on Windows in 2023    |
|                                        |
------------------------------------------

It has been confusing that how to build NetHack on Windows platform. The code 
seemed to use lots of 32-bit or unix-like tools which were hard to configure. 
Recently I found that the development team provided a simple way to build the 
game with the Visual Studio toolchain.

The build only requires VS2022 (2017/2019 is also OK) and some Windows SDK
(on my platform, 10.0.20348.0 for VS 2022) to be installed. It is also much 
more convenient if Git is available. My platform is Windows 11 amd64.

Firstly clone the source code.
> git clone https://github.com/nethack/nethack
> cd nethack

Then install some dependencies. (Download them manually if compiling without 
Git)
> git submodule init
> git submodule update

Now open the solution (sys/windows/vs/nethack.sln) in VS and click build.
When building it will show an error if the correct version of Windows SDK 
isn't available.
After a successful build, the NetHack executable is in binary/debug/x64.
