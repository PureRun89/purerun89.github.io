Recently my new project required me to run program in consoles and get the 
real-time "snapshot" (that is the text content and its color) of the program by 
Rust Language. I found KITTY a fantastic tool to do this work. (btw there are 
many terminal emulators in 2023 now but it's really hard to find one that 
supports snapshot :( )

<strong> 1. Installation and configure kitty </strong>

According to the official website, on MacOS and Linux kitty can be installed by 
simple command:
> curl -L https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/installer.sh | sh /dev/stdin

and the path of binary will be ~/.local/kitty.app/bin (on Linux)
On Windows I have to use WSL in order to use kitty.

After installation, the kitty terminal emulator can be run by 'cd' the binary 
path and run './kitty', but on some platforms there are bugs that make terminal 
stuck when running some programs. To prevent kitty from stuck, use this command 
> LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ./kitty

You can configure kitty by creating a config file (The file doesn't exist 
defaultly) at ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf

For example, to configure the kitty window size:
(in ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf)
# window settings
remember_window_size no
initial_window_width 100c
initial_window_height 30c

<strong> 2. Remote control and get snapshot </strong>

Kitty allows remote control, that is controlling other programs in this or 
another kitty window by shell command.

To start a kitty session that allows remote control, run the following command 
> ./kitty -o allow_remote_control=yes -o enabled_layouts=tall

Then in the running kitty window, run another kitty's command called "KITTEN" 
to run other programs:
> ./kitten @ launch --title bash --keep-focus --type os-window bash
> ./kitten @ send-text --match cmdline:bash blahblah

Run this command to get a snapshot
> kitten @ get-text --match cmdline:{...}
The result will only contain the plain text. To include text color and cursor 
position, add the parameters "--ansi --add-cursor".

Kitty kindly use the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code"> ANSI escape code </a>in its 'get-text --ansi' result.

By the way, there is a nice library called "ansi-parser" on crates.io for 
parsing those ANSI escape code in Rust.

<strong> 3. Some alternatives </strong>

Before I found kitty as a nice tool, I tried other ways to run program and get 
snapshot.

Actually, I tried to run the program in Windows Terminal, and continuously 
send keystrokes "Ctrl+Shift+A, Ctrl+Shift+C" to get snapshot. Rust has two 
crates, "enigo" for sending keystrokes, and "clipboard-win" for reading text 
from pasteboard.

The problem is that I can't get cursor position in this way, and the terminal 
flashes too much because of the selecting. Thus I turned to kitty.
