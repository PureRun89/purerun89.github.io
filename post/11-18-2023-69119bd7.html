-----------------------------------------------------------

Despite using type checkers which "has been proved to be sound", Rust still has 
several bugs of its type system in 2023. Some of the bugs can turn references 
with any lifetime into &'static or &'static mut ones, and #25860 is one of the 
most known one.

In issue #25860, user "aturon" showed the following code that do the trick.

<div style="background:#BBFFFF">
static UNIT: &'static &'static () = &&();

fn foo<'a, 'b, T>(_: &'a &'b (), v: &'b T) -> &'a T { v }

fn bad<'a, T>(x: &'a T) -> &'static T {
    let f: fn(_, &'a T) -> &'static T = foo;
    f(UNIT, x)
}
</div>

To understand that code, we need to firstly know how types and lifetimes work. 
As we know, functions (and structs, traits, ...) in Rust may contain lifetime 
bounds, but what happens when they are called with random lifetimes? Actually, 
Rust compiler checks if the input type can be a "supertype" of the target type 
using the technique of "Subtyping and Variance", and cast the target type into 
the input type.

For example, we define a function and a main body:

<div style="background:#BBFFFF">
fn foo<'a, 'b>(p1: &'a (), p2: &'b ()) where 'b: 'a {}

fn main() {
    let i1 = ();
    let p1 = &i1; // &'a
    {
        let i2 = ();
        let p2 = &i2; // &'b
        foo(p1, p2);
    }
}
</div>

Seems we call the function while the lifetime of "p1" is longer than the one of 
"p2" that 'b:'a isn't satisfied, but actually the code works. The reason is:
the type of "foo(p1, p2)" can be written as "foo(&'a, &'b)" and 'a is a subtype 
of 'b, so the target "foo(&'x, &'y) where 'y: 'x" can be casted into 
"foo(&'b, &'b)" and then "foo(&'a, &'b)", because the parameter of a function 
is contravariant to the lifetime.


Now it seems that the type checker works very properly, but because of unknown 
reason, it has a bug that the lifetime bound can be dropped when doing the type 
casting. Let's use the code in #25860 above as an example. It can be written in 
a more clear way:

<div style="background:#BBFFFF">
fn foo<'a, 'b, T>(_: &'a &'b (), v: &'b T) -> &'a T { v }

fn bad<'a, T>(x: &'a T) -> &'static T {
    let f1: for<'x, 'y> fn(&'x &'y (), &'y T) -> &'x T = foo;
    // 1. Copy the function here
    let f2: for<'x> fn(&'x &'a (), &'a T) -> &'x T = f1;
    // 2. Instantiate 'y as 'a
    let f3: for<'x> fn(&'x &'static (), &'a T) -> &'x T = f2;
    // 3. By contravariant, turn &'x &'a into &'x &'static
    let f4: fn(&'static &'static (), &'a T) -> &'static T = f3;
    // 4. Instantiate 'x as 'static
    f4(&&() as &'static &'static (), x)
}
</div>

The original bound 'b:'a does nothing when casting the type of "foo".

After turning this out, someone suggested in #25860 changing the way 
contravariant works, but later an user posted another approach to this bug, 
only using covariant:

<div style="background:#BBFFFF">
fn foo<'a, 'b, T>(_: &'a (), v: &'b T) -> (&'a &'b (), &'a T) {
    (&&() as &'static &'static (), v as &'a T)
}
fn bad<'a, T>(x: &'a T) -> &'static T {
    let f1: for<'x, 'y> fn(&'x (), &'y T) -> (&'x &'y (), &'x T) = foo;
    let f2: for<'y> fn(&'static (), &'y T) -> (&'static &'y (), &'static T)
        = f1;
    let f3: for<'y> fn(&'static (), &'y T) -> (&'y &'y (), &'static T) = f2;
    let f4: fn(&'static (), &'a T) -> (&'a &'a (), &'static T) = f3;
    f4(&(), x).1
}
</div>

The essence of the problem is just that the "where bound" (or those implicit 
bounds like &'a &'b T) are dropped randomly, and this also caused other 
unsound bugs like #84591 and #98117. The developers of Rust compiler 
find this bug hard to fix. Someone suggested inproving the Rust's type system 
by making HRTB written as for<...> where<...>, but it was refused by Rust team, 
and the team is working in another way to try fixing the unsoundness. 
Seems they will publish the new version of type checker in the nightly Rust 
later and we can use it by adding "-Ztrait-solver=next" to rustc.
