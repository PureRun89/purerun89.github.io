----------------------------------------

Rust uses crates and modules to organize the source code of a project.
Each project that produces a binary or library is considered a crate. In every 
crate there might be a tree of modules.

<strong> 1. Declare and use modules in one file </strong>

Let's firstly consider how modules work in only one file 'main.rs'.

Every module has a path. The path 'crate' is the root of the package. For 
example, one can define some functions in the crate:

fn a(s: i32) { println!("{}", s) }

Then the path of 'a' is 'crate::a'. It can be directly called in main function, 
like 'fn main() {a()}', but you can also call it by the path:

fn main() { crate::a(1) } // or
fn main() { use crate::a; a(1) }
// Some trick
fn main() { let a = 1; crate::a(a) }



In the file you can define some modules with the syntax
mod module_name; // no body
mod module_name { ... } // with a body
pub mod ... // public module

The content in the module is defaultly private. To make it visible to super 
scopes, use the 'pub' before 'mod'. The 'pub' can be replaced with 
'pub(crate)' or 'pub(super)' to specify which scope can access the module.

A module declaration can contain one or no body. If it doesn't have a body, 
Rust compiler will find its content in other Rust source files. If it has a 
body, its content is defined in the body. (Except for other modules in it, and 
I'll talk about that later) Now I'm talking about one-file programming so I use 
the module with a body:

mod a {
    pub mod b {
        pub fn c() { println!("pub"); }
        fn d () { println!("private"); }
    }
}

Now the module tree looks like
crate
 |- a
    |- b
       |- c
       |- d

In the main function you can call functions from the modules.

fn main() {
    a::b::c();
    // private items are not accessible
    // a::b::d();
    crate::a::b::c(); // This one also OK.
}


To simplify the function call (or other access to items in modules), use the 
'use' statement.
It can be placed anywhere in the file. 'Using' an item multiple times isn't 
allowed.

use a::b;
fn main() {
    use b::c;
    c();
}



<strong> 2. How modules work among multiple files </strong>

When declaring a module with no body, Rust compiler looks for the content in 
other files. For a module with a path 'a::b::c', the compiler find it in the 
file 'a/b/c.rs' (Long time before they used the 'a/b/c/mod.rs' but now it's 
not suggested)

For example, if you write the following in 'main.rs':
mod a;
mod b {
    mod c { ... }
    mod d;
}

then the module 'a' is at 'a.rs', and the module 'd' is at 'b/d.rs'.

In those module files you can declare sub-modules, for example, writting this 
in 'a.rs':
pub mod e { ... }

and then access 'a::e::...' in 'main.rs'.


<strong> 3. More about 'use' and module declaration </strong>'

'use' something with an alias: use ... as alias_name;

'use' while specifying the scope:
'use' considers its outside module as its default scope, that is 'self'. To 
choose another scope, use 'crate' or 'super' after 'use':

fn a() { ... }
mod b {
    fn a() { ... }
    mod c {
        a(); // call b::a
        super::a(); // call crate::a
        crate::a(); // same as above
    }
}

It's notable that the 'super' is only allowed in the beginning of the path, 
that is 'super::super::a' is OK but 'super::a::super::...' isn't.

Before the module declaration, a 'path' prefix can be added to tell the 
compiler to find the module body in another file:

#[path = "aa"]
mod a {
    #[path = "bb.rs"]
    mod b;
}

In the code above, the module 'a::b' is located at 'aa/bb.rs'.
